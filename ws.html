      <h1>Toshi Omagari’s updated version opens up the typeface - version opens up the typeface</h1>
      <p>The decorative blackletter – <a href="#">which offers a stark contrast with</a> the other four typefaces included in the Wolpe Collection – drew on Berthold Wolpe’s time working in a metal foundry. As a result, it adopts the kinds of angular forms that would have been more easily chiselled into metal – appearing slightly less intricate than fellow blackletter faces.</p>

      <blockquote>An early specimen sheet, published in 1938, said the typeface was intending to cause a stir among “horizon-scanning advertisers”, however the design quickly fell into obscurity, particularly as a result of blackletter’s connotations.</blockquote>

      <p>There were reportedly only two sets of matrices ever made of Sachsenwald, which otherwise has lived on only through original drawings held by the Monotype archive.</p>

      <p>As you’d expect, examples of it being used are limited, however it can be seen in a rare edition of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, published by Fanfare Press in the 1940s.</p>

      <p>Toshi Omagari’s updated version opens up the typeface for experimentation by today’s designers, and also introduces elements that make it easier for today’s purposes – including a romanized version of the distinctive traditional German X originally used in Sachsenwald.</p>
